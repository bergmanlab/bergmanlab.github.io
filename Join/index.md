The Bergman Lab currently has open positions for undergraduate researchers. Please note that research in the Bergman lab is 100% computational, and we currently are only taking on undergraduate researchers who have some background in programming or computing. If you have some experience in these areas, please send a copy of your CV to [Casey Bergman](mailto:cbergman@uga.edu) and we can discuss further.
