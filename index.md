## The Bergman Lab

We are a small research group in the <a href="http://www.genetics.uga.edu/">Department of Genetics</a> and <a href="http://iob.uga.edu/">Institute of Bioinformatics</a> at the <a href="http://uga.edu/">University of Georgia</a> working on various aspects of genome biology. We use diverse computational methods to better understand genome structure, function, and evolution. Our work capitalizes on the growing volume of genomic data available over the last three decades, which offers an unparalleled opportunity for biological discovery in 21st century.

The basic rationale underlying research in the lab is that evolutionary processes have encoded functional and historical signals in genomes that can be decoded using computational and statistical methods. Using <em>in silico</em> techniques, we aim to infer the mechanistic and evolutionary forces that have shaped modern eukaryotic genomes over long periods of time in their natural environments. This inferential approach complements classical experimental methods in biology, and has the potential to reveal deep insights into biological processes that are not possible using <em>in vitro</em> or <em>in vivo</em> methods.

We place a high priority on collaboration, scholarship, craftsmanship and openness in the lab, and welcome inquries about <a href="https://bergmanlab.github.io/Join">joining the lab</a> or new projects with experimental or computer scientists.
