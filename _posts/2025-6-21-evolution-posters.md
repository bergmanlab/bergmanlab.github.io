Bergman Lab graduate student Oliver Lasey Bergman each presented posters at the [Evolution 2025 Conference](https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/). Oliver presented on "Detection of mobile element insertions in graphical pangenomes with miniME", and Casey presented work led by former graduate Jingxuan Chen on "Horizontal Transfer and Recombination Fuel Ty4 Retrotransposon Evolution in *Saccharomyces*" using HiFi reads". We're very lucky to have this fantastic conference come to Athens this summer!
