Bergman Lab graduate student Oliver Lasey Bergman each presented posters at the [Evolution 2025 Conference](https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/). Oliver presented on "Detection of mobile element insertions in graphical pangenomes with miniME", and Casey presented work led by former graduate Jingxuan Chen on "Chromosome-level genome assembly for *Hymenolepis diminuta*</em>* using HiFi reads". We're very lucky to have this fantastic conference come to Athens, GA this summer!
