Congratulations to Bergman Lab collaborator [Raíssa Nogueira de Brito](https://anthropology.uga.edu/directory/people/raissa-nogueira-de-brito) for receiving the [2025 UGA Postdoctoral Research Award](https://research.uga.edu/research-awards/2025/03/19/raissa-nogueira-de-brito/). We are very lucky to be working with Raissa and her supervisor [Nicole Gottdenker](https://vet.uga.edu/person/nicole_gottdenker/) on understanding the genomic determinants of phenotypic differences underlying vector capacity in closely related Kissing Bug species. Bravo Raíssa!
